# GetElected
A Java game about political silliness I'd like to make into a mobile game.

The game concept is simple: convince enough voters to not only come out to vote but to vote for you, no matter how ridiculous you appear.

In essence, this is a silly card game. Each "turn" represents a day on the campaign trail. Each day you will recieve a random number of "cards" - the cards are events in the game. The events may be static, as in an event simply happens to you. Other events might offer you a choice. Once the choice is made and the event's affects determined, you move onto the next card and the next until the day ends.

In the short game, there will be 100 days between elections. In the long game, there will be 300 days between elections. Each election gets you into higher office. The offices are: Alderman, State House Rep, State Senator, Governor, US Representative, US Senator, Vice President, President, King of the World (... might get sillier as we go.)

The player begins with one vote - their own. They have voted themselves into office as an Alderman in their municipality with a write in vote. They spend the next election cycle trying to avoid sex & money scandals while trying to convince voters to show up and vote for them. They either win or lose the vote, then repeat.

Each card will either add or subtract voters and/or votes. For example, a card may add more voters, but because the electorate feels the election is "a lock", they may be less likely to show up to vote.
